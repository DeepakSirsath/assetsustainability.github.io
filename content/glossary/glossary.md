## **Glossary**

**Ambient and Time (RATING)** : The rating of the motor is the ambient (room) temperature vs. the time it can operate at that temperature. Most motors are rated for continuous duty. The most common rating is 400C AMB-CONT.

**Amps (Amperes)** : The measure of electrical current. Amp ratings indicate the average motor input current the motor can be expected to draw under full load conditions. There are three common motor amp ratings: 
- No-load amps is the current draw when the motor is unloaded. 
- Full-load amps is the current required during full-rated load operation. 
- Locked-rotor or start-up amps is the current when the motor rotor is stopped or locked and indicates the maximum amount of current that could be expected during the first few seconds of startup. 

**Annual Motor Expense (Change)** : (Annual Motor Expense (Last Year) - Annual Motor Expense (YTD))/Annual Motor Expense (Last Year) * 100; expressed as %. Indicator indicates % trend.

**Annual Motor Expense (Last Year)** : Comparable (to Year to Date time period) year-to-date summary of Motor Portfolio Expense from previous year.

**Annual Motor Expense (YTD)** : Year-to-date summary of Motor Portfolio Expense.

**Apparent Power (kVA)** : The apparent power (measured in kVA) is calculated using the following formula: Apparent Power (kVA) = √3 x Voltage (V) x Current (A)

**Base Load** : Base load in the non-weather related load. 

**Base Year** : Established base to assess on-going energy performance.

**Bearings DE** : Drive End (output shaft end) bearing number.

**Bearings ODE** : Opposite Drive End (fan end or rear of motor) bearing number.

**Breakdown Torque** : Maximum torque that the operating motor can produce before stalling. 

**Best Practice: Motor Efficiency** : This value is equivalent to the highest efficiency motor available on the market, equal in size to the motor in use in the system being analyzed.  Motors@Work performs analysis of equivalent size and specifications to the one in use in the pumping system being analyzed, and use its motor efficiency value as the Best Practice Value.

**Best Practice: Pump Hydraulic Efficiency** : This value is equivalent to the highest value currently attainable in industry. Values are available from the MyPumps measurements. The MyPumps measurements will provide an "Optimal Efficiency" value for the Pump Efficiency, input this value as Best Practice.

**Best Practice: Design Friction Losses** : The Friction Losses that the system was designed for (in meters of head per kilometer of pipeline), if known.  If unknown, Motors@Work provides some typical values to calculate the system pressure drop.

**Catalog Motor Efficiency** : Catalog Motor Efficiency =100 - ((Equivalent Catalog Motor Efficiency - Motor Actual Efficiency)/Equivalent Catalog Motor Efficiency 

**Catalog Number** : Manufacturer motor model type identifier. If nameplate is blank the motor is custom. Number may also a unique OEM part or modification.

**CC** : Nameplate Certified Compliant number. This number appears on all motors that require compliance with U.S. energy law.

**CO2e Emission Factor (Electricity)** : Different electricity suppliers have different Emission Factors, which reflect the different generation mixes from which the suppliers source their electricity. 

**Current (I or amps)** : Current is the rate at which electric charge flows past a point in a circuit. Current is normally based on a second as the unit of measure. 

**Demand (kWh or kilo-watt hrs.)** : Demand is also a time-based value. The demand is the average rate of energy use over time. The actual label for demand is kilowatt-hours/hour but this is normally reduced to kilowatts. To calculate demand it is necessary to accumulate the energy readings and adjust the energy reading to an hourly value that constitutes the demand.

**Demand Charge** : Component of utility rate based on peak demand experienced and average power factor for billing period. The Demand Charge is usually based on the highest 15- or 30-minute period of energy consumption each month. Demand charges are becoming common for industrial and commercial customers, ranging as high as $.20 per kilowatt per month in the United States. 

**Design** : There are four standard motor designs: A, B, C, and D. NEMA Design A and B motors are for general use in relatively low-torque applications, such as centrifugal pumps, fans, and steady-torque machines. Designs A and B are identical, except that Design B has a limit on startup current. Design C and D motors produce high startup torque and are designed for use in conveyers, cranes, lifts, punch tools, and other high-torque applications. 

**Design Basis** : Expected energy consumption rate per unit of measure of a specific motor or motor-driven system.

**Design Performance** : Design Performance = (HP * .7456 * Hrs (monthly operating schedule)* $ (Utility Rate)/(100 -((Nameplate Efficiency - Motor Actual Efficiency)/Nameplate Efficiency) - (HP * .7456 * Hrs (monthly operating schedule)* $ (Utility Rate))/Nameplate Efficiency. Expressed in dollars.

**Drive system** : The electrical supply, electric motor, speed controls, gear box, or belt system. 

**EAM System** : Enterprise asset management (EAM) is the optimal lifecycle management of the physical assets of an organization. It covers subjects including the design, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance and decommissioning or replacement of plant, equipment and facilities. "Enterprise" refers to the scope of the assets across departments, locations, facilities and, potentially, business units.

**Efficiency** : The percentage of the input power that is actually converted to work output from the motor shaft. There are several methods of measuring motor efficiency, but the standard that should be used exclusively in the United States is the IEEE 112-B (nearly the same as NEMA MG1-20.52). This standard specifies a test protocol that uses a dynamometer to test motor output under specific load levels. All efficiency values stored in the Motors@Work database and used in calculations by the software are nominal efficiencies based on IEEE 112-B. 

**Electricity Consumed (kWh)** : Electricity Consumed (kWh) = Electrical Power Consumed (kW) x Operating Hours (hrs.) 

**Electricity Cost ($)** : Electricity Cost ($) = Electricity Consumed (kWh) x Electricity Average Unit Price ($/kWh).

**Electrical Power Consumed** : The Electric Power Consumed is equal to the power consumed while the Motor is operating.  The Electrical Power consumed is equal to either the:
- Actual Motor Power (kW), or
- Motor kVA x Power Factor, or
- Rated Motor Power (kW) / Motor Efficiency (%)

**Enclosure (ENCL)** : The enclosure, or housing/cooling method, for which a motor is designed for.  Different motor enclosures are designed to withstand various levels of exposure to moisture, particles, and chemicals. The four most common types of enclosures are Open Drip Proof, Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled, Totally Enclosed Non-ventilated, and Explosion Proof however there are also Hazardous Location, Totally Enclosed Wash Down and Totally Enclosed Air Over.

**Energy (Wh or watt hrs.)** : Energy is always based on some time increment. It is the integration of power over a defined time increment. Energy is an important value because almost all electric bills are based, in part, on the amount of energy used. Typically, electrical energy is measured in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh). A kilowatt-hour represents a constant load of one thousand watts (one kilowatt) for one hour. 

**Energy Efficiency** : The ratio of design basis to the actual energy consumption.

**Energy efficient motor** : A motor with a nominal full-load efficiency rating that meets or exceeds the NEMA Table 12-11 standard. Many manufacturers sell motors with efficiencies significantly higher than the NEMA standard and designate these as Premium Efficient motors. NEMA Premium EfficiencyTM motors must have full-load efficiencies that equal or exceed the minimum values given in Table 12-12 of NEMA MG 1-1998, Rev 2. 

**EnergyStar Rating** : EPA's Portfolio Manager helps manage the energy performance of Customer properties they you own, manage, or hold for investment. Thousands of organizations have used Portfolio Manager to benchmark the energy performance of their facilities operations, track improvement, and apply for recognition from EPA: Top-performing buildings can earn the ENERGY STAR, the national symbol for protecting the environment through energy efficiency; and Organizations with building portfolios that show a 10%, 20%, 30% (or more) reduction in normalized energy use or achieve a 75 rating average, can earn ENERGY STAR Leaders recognition.

**Energy Performance Indicators (EPI)** :  EPIs are useful for comparison purposes to allow plant operators to compare their performance both internally (i.e. internal benchmarking over a period of time) and externally (to that of other plants).  Caution should be exercised when comparing EPIs as they are plant specific and are influenced by variables such as plant size, total static head, motor efficiencies etc. Care should be taken when comparing to values for other stations when the EPI is dependent on the AUP for electricity which is dependent on the electricity supplier and may change from plant to plant and from time to time and where the EPI is dependent on the emission factor, which may vary from plant to plant and from time to time. 

**Explosion Proof (EXPL)** : is a type of TEFC motor designed to prevent sparks or explosions within the motor from igniting flammable materials outside. 

**Fluid Density** : Density of the fluid being pumped in kg/m3.

**Frame size** : NEMA defined standard motor frame dimensions. Motor dimension standardization is reflected by the “frame” size number. This number reflects the same mounting and shaft information between different manufacturers in order to be consistent.

**Friction Loss** : Friction Loss (%) = 1 - "Piping" Efficiency (%)

**Full-load RPM** : The actual speed that a motor turns under its full-rated load, which is typically about 2 percent slower than the synchronous speed. Since even a small change in operating speed can affect the efficiency of pumps and fans, select a replacement motor with a similar full-load rpm for these applications. 

**Full-load torque** : is the torque measured at full load. 

**Growing Degree Days** : Growing Degree Days are a simplified form of historical weather data relative to deriving an estimating unit for the demand for energy required for water processes. 

**Hazardous Location (HAZ)** : Hazardous location motor applications are classified by the type of hazardous environment present, the characteristics of the specific material creating the hazard, the probability of exposure to the environment, and the maximum temperature level that is considered safe for the substance creating the hazard.

**Health (Coefficient) Index** : Indicator that monitors energy performance relative to “Best Case”. 

**Hertz (Hz)** : The frequency for which the motor is designed.  Hertz is measured in cycles per second. The most common frequency in the US is 60 Hz. The most common frequency outside the US is 50 Hz.

**Horsepower (HP)** : Measurement of work done per unit of time. The Rated Motor Power is typically taken from the motor nameplate or motor documentation.  

**Insulation Code (CLASS)** : Insulation codes (nameplate) are designated in order of their thermal capabilities by A, B, F, and H. The higher the designated Code letter, the greater the heat capability.

**Intensity** : Ratio of total energy use to specified metric (e.g. sq. ft., units of production, etc.).

**Interval Data** : Near real-time energy consumption related to a specific asset (e.g. 5 min., 15 min., hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly).

**IRR** : Internal Rate of Return

**kWh/m3** : This is the most commonly used EPI in water pumping applications.  It is particularly useful for monitoring energy performance at one facility over time.  It is less useful for comparison purposes because comparisons are only valid for plants with similar design & operating parameters.

**kWh/1,000m3/m** : This is useful for internal comparison and, importantly, for computing performance between different plants because it account for differences in static head.

**lbCO2e Emitted** : lbCO2e Emitted = Electricity Consumed (kWh) x Emission Factor (lbCO2e/kWh) 

**Length of pipe** : The length of piping in the pumping system in feet or kilometers.  This can be determined from system drawings or estimated.
