## **Glossary**

**Ambient and Time (RATING)** : The rating of the motor is the ambient (room) temperature vs. the time it can operate at that temperature. Most motors are rated for continuous duty. The most common rating is 400C AMB-CONT.

**Amps (Amperes)** : The measure of electrical current. Amp ratings indicate the average motor input current the motor can be expected to draw under full load conditions. There are three common motor amp ratings: 
- No-load amps is the current draw when the motor is unloaded. 
- Full-load amps is the current required during full-rated load operation. 
- Locked-rotor or start-up amps is the current when the motor rotor is stopped or locked and indicates the maximum amount of current that could be expected during the first few seconds of startup. 

**Annual Motor Expense (Change)** : (Annual Motor Expense (Last Year) - Annual Motor Expense (YTD))/Annual Motor Expense (Last Year) * 100; expressed as %. Indicator indicates % trend.

**Annual Motor Expense (Last Year)** : Comparable (to Year to Date time period) year-to-date summary of Motor Portfolio Expense from previous year.

**Annual Motor Expense (YTD)** : Year-to-date summary of Motor Portfolio Expense.

**Apparent Power (kVA)** : The apparent power (measured in kVA) is calculated using the following formula: Apparent Power (kVA) = √3 x Voltage (V) x Current (A)

**Base Load** : Base load in the non-weather related load. 

**Base Year** : Established base to assess on-going energy performance.

**Bearings DE** : Drive End (output shaft end) bearing number.

**Bearings ODE** : Opposite Drive End (fan end or rear of motor) bearing number.

**Breakdown Torque** : Maximum torque that the operating motor can produce before stalling. 

**Best Practice: Motor Efficiency** : This value is equivalent to the highest efficiency motor available on the market, equal in size to the motor in use in the system being analyzed.  Motors@Work performs analysis of equivalent size and specifications to the one in use in the pumping system being analyzed, and use its motor efficiency value as the Best Practice Value.

**Best Practice: Pump Hydraulic Efficiency** : This value is equivalent to the highest value currently attainable in industry. Values are available from the MyPumps measurements. The MyPumps measurements will provide an "Optimal Efficiency" value for the Pump Efficiency, input this value as Best Practice.

**Best Practice: Design Friction Losses** : The Friction Losses that the system was designed for (in meters of head per kilometer of pipeline), if known.  If unknown, Motors@Work provides some typical values to calculate the system pressure drop.

**Catalog Motor Efficiency** : Catalog Motor Efficiency =100 - ((Equivalent Catalog Motor Efficiency - Motor Actual Efficiency)/Equivalent Catalog Motor Efficiency 

**Catalog Number** : Manufacturer motor model type identifier. If nameplate is blank the motor is custom. Number may also a unique OEM part or modification.

**CC** : Nameplate Certified Compliant number. This number appears on all motors that require compliance with U.S. energy law.

**CO2e Emission Factor (Electricity)** : Different electricity suppliers have different Emission Factors, which reflect the different generation mixes from which the suppliers source their electricity. 

**Current (I or amps)** : Current is the rate at which electric charge flows past a point in a circuit. Current is normally based on a second as the unit of measure. 

**Demand (kWh or kilo-watt hrs.)** : Demand is also a time-based value. The demand is the average rate of energy use over time. The actual label for demand is kilowatt-hours/hour but this is normally reduced to kilowatts. To calculate demand it is necessary to accumulate the energy readings and adjust the energy reading to an hourly value that constitutes the demand.

**Demand Charge** : Component of utility rate based on peak demand experienced and average power factor for billing period. The Demand Charge is usually based on the highest 15- or 30-minute period of energy consumption each month. Demand charges are becoming common for industrial and commercial customers, ranging as high as $.20 per kilowatt per month in the United States. 

**Design** : There are four standard motor designs: A, B, C, and D. NEMA Design A and B motors are for general use in relatively low-torque applications, such as centrifugal pumps, fans, and steady-torque machines. Designs A and B are identical, except that Design B has a limit on startup current. Design C and D motors produce high startup torque and are designed for use in conveyers, cranes, lifts, punch tools, and other high-torque applications. 

**Design Basis** : Expected energy consumption rate per unit of measure of a specific motor or motor-driven system.

**Design Performance** : Design Performance = (HP * .7456 * Hrs (monthly operating schedule)* $ (Utility Rate)/(100 -((Nameplate Efficiency - Motor Actual Efficiency)/Nameplate Efficiency) - (HP * .7456 * Hrs (monthly operating schedule)* $ (Utility Rate))/Nameplate Efficiency. Expressed in dollars.

**Drive system** : The electrical supply, electric motor, speed controls, gear box, or belt system. 

**EAM System** : Enterprise asset management (EAM) is the optimal lifecycle management of the physical assets of an organization. It covers subjects including the design, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance and decommissioning or replacement of plant, equipment and facilities. "Enterprise" refers to the scope of the assets across departments, locations, facilities and, potentially, business units.

**Efficiency** : The percentage of the input power that is actually converted to work output from the motor shaft. There are several methods of measuring motor efficiency, but the standard that should be used exclusively in the United States is the IEEE 112-B (nearly the same as NEMA MG1-20.52). This standard specifies a test protocol that uses a dynamometer to test motor output under specific load levels. All efficiency values stored in the Motors@Work database and used in calculations by the software are nominal efficiencies based on IEEE 112-B. 

**Electricity Consumed (kWh)** : Electricity Consumed (kWh) = Electrical Power Consumed (kW) x Operating Hours (hrs.) 

**Electricity Cost ($)** : Electricity Cost ($) = Electricity Consumed (kWh) x Electricity Average Unit Price ($/kWh).

**Electrical Power Consumed** : The Electric Power Consumed is equal to the power consumed while the Motor is operating.  The Electrical Power consumed is equal to either the:
- Actual Motor Power (kW), or
- Motor kVA x Power Factor, or
- Rated Motor Power (kW) / Motor Efficiency (%)

**Enclosure (ENCL)** : The enclosure, or housing/cooling method, for which a motor is designed for.  Different motor enclosures are designed to withstand various levels of exposure to moisture, particles, and chemicals. The four most common types of enclosures are Open Drip Proof, Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled, Totally Enclosed Non-ventilated, and Explosion Proof however there are also Hazardous Location, Totally Enclosed Wash Down and Totally Enclosed Air Over.

**Energy (Wh or watt hrs.)** : Energy is always based on some time increment. It is the integration of power over a defined time increment. Energy is an important value because almost all electric bills are based, in part, on the amount of energy used. Typically, electrical energy is measured in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh). A kilowatt-hour represents a constant load of one thousand watts (one kilowatt) for one hour. 

**Energy Efficiency** : The ratio of design basis to the actual energy consumption.

**Energy efficient motor** : A motor with a nominal full-load efficiency rating that meets or exceeds the NEMA Table 12-11 standard. Many manufacturers sell motors with efficiencies significantly higher than the NEMA standard and designate these as Premium Efficient motors. NEMA Premium EfficiencyTM motors must have full-load efficiencies that equal or exceed the minimum values given in Table 12-12 of NEMA MG 1-1998, Rev 2. 

**EnergyStar Rating** : EPA's Portfolio Manager helps manage the energy performance of Customer properties they you own, manage, or hold for investment. Thousands of organizations have used Portfolio Manager to benchmark the energy performance of their facilities operations, track improvement, and apply for recognition from EPA: Top-performing buildings can earn the ENERGY STAR, the national symbol for protecting the environment through energy efficiency; and Organizations with building portfolios that show a 10%, 20%, 30% (or more) reduction in normalized energy use or achieve a 75 rating average, can earn ENERGY STAR Leaders recognition.

**Energy Performance Indicators (EPI)** :  EPIs are useful for comparison purposes to allow plant operators to compare their performance both internally (i.e. internal benchmarking over a period of time) and externally (to that of other plants).  Caution should be exercised when comparing EPIs as they are plant specific and are influenced by variables such as plant size, total static head, motor efficiencies etc. Care should be taken when comparing to values for other stations when the EPI is dependent on the AUP for electricity which is dependent on the electricity supplier and may change from plant to plant and from time to time and where the EPI is dependent on the emission factor, which may vary from plant to plant and from time to time. 

**Explosion Proof (EXPL)** : is a type of TEFC motor designed to prevent sparks or explosions within the motor from igniting flammable materials outside. 

**Fluid Density** : Density of the fluid being pumped in kg/m3.

**Frame size** : NEMA defined standard motor frame dimensions. Motor dimension standardization is reflected by the “frame” size number. This number reflects the same mounting and shaft information between different manufacturers in order to be consistent.

**Friction Loss** : Friction Loss (%) = 1 - "Piping" Efficiency (%)

**Full-load RPM** : The actual speed that a motor turns under its full-rated load, which is typically about 2 percent slower than the synchronous speed. Since even a small change in operating speed can affect the efficiency of pumps and fans, select a replacement motor with a similar full-load rpm for these applications. 

**Full-load torque** : is the torque measured at full load. 

**Growing Degree Days** : Growing Degree Days are a simplified form of historical weather data relative to deriving an estimating unit for the demand for energy required for water processes. 

**Hazardous Location (HAZ)** : Hazardous location motor applications are classified by the type of hazardous environment present, the characteristics of the specific material creating the hazard, the probability of exposure to the environment, and the maximum temperature level that is considered safe for the substance creating the hazard.

**Health (Coefficient) Index** : Indicator that monitors energy performance relative to “Best Case”.

**Interval Data** : Near real-time energy consumption related to a specific asset (e.g. 5 min., 15 min., hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly).

**IRR** : Internal Rate of Return

**kWh/m3** : This is the most commonly used EPI in water pumping applications. It is particularly useful for monitoring energy performance at one facility over time.  It is less useful for comparison purposes because comparisons are only valid for plants with similar design & operating parameters.

**kWh/1,000m3/m** : This is useful for internal comparison and, importantly, for computing performance between different plants because it account for differences in static head.

**lbCO2e Emitted** : lbCO2e Emitted = Electricity Consumed (kWh) x Emission Factor (lbCO2e/kWh) 

**Length of pipe** : The length of piping in the pumping system in feet or kilometers. This can be determined from system drawings or estimated.  

**Load Factor (Utility Bill)** : Load Factor is the ratio between average demand and peak (or metered) demand and is commonly calculated by billing period. Load factor analysis of monthly Utility Bill can inform user whether they should focus on reducing energy consumption or TOU demand

**Load factor (Motor)** : Nameplate code for Load Factor. Load Factor is a measure of the ratio between a motor’s operating output and its design output. For example, a 10-horsepower motor driving a 7.5-horsepower load has a 75 percent load factor. 

**Locked Rotor Amps (CODE)** : When AC motors are started with full voltage (Across-the-Line Starting), they draw line amperage 300% to 600% greater than their full load running current. The magnitude of the “inrush current” (also called locked rotor amps or LRA) is determined by motor horsepower and design characteristics.

**Manufacturer** :  Motor manufacturer’s company name. The manufacturers with commercially available motors are included in the Motors@Work database. 

**Meter (Utility)** : A Meter Point Reference Number is a unique number assigned to every single electricity connection and meter.  The meter number is very important because it allows to track exactly where each connection on the electricity network is located (no matter who the electricity supplier is). The meter number is prominently displayed on the electricity bills from the Supplier.  

**Model Name** : The name given by the manufacturer. If no specific name is provided, it is listed as “Standard.” 

**Motor Loss** : Motor Loss (%) = 1 - Motor Efficiency (%)

**Motor Portfolio** :  Sum of all motors expense for a specific month. Individual Motor Expense = (Motor (HP) * .7456 * hrs. (monthly operating schedule) * $ (Utility Rate) / efficiency) 

**Motor Shaft Power** : This is the mechanical power available at the output shaft of the motor; it is equal to the electrical power consumed less the motor losses (such as motor winding losses, motor inertia etc.). It is calculated automatically using the formula: Motor Shaft Power (kW) = Electrical Power Consumed (kW) x Motor Efficiency (%).

**My Motor Efficiency** : My Motor Efficiency =100 -((Nameplate Efficiency - Motor Actual Efficiency)/Nameplate Efficiency).

**NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association)** : A trade organization of motor manufacturers. NEMA sets standards and publishes information used extensively in the motor industry.

**NEMA Design Types** : NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) designs have unique speed-torque-slip relationships - making them suited for different type of applications.

**NEMA design A** :
  - Maximum 5% slip
  - High to medium starting current
  - Normal locked rotor torque
  - Normal breakdown torque

  - Low starting current
  - Very high locked rotor torque
  - Suited for equipment with very high inertia starts - like cranes, hoists etc.

**Nominal efficiency** : An average value based on testing of a population of motors per IEEE 112-B. Since small variations in actual efficiencies are statistically expected, some motors will test a little higher or lower than their nominal ratings. NEMA has established guaranteed minimum efficiency values for each nominal efficiency to take into account this variation. All values in the Motors@Work database are nominal rather than guaranteed minimum efficiencies. 

**NPV** : Net Present Value

**OEM Performance** : OEM Performance = (HP * .7456 * Hrs (monthly operating schedule) * $ (Utility Rate)/ (100 -((Equivalent Catalog - Motor Actual Efficiency)/Equivalent Catalog Efficiency) - (HP * .7456 * Hrs. (monthly operating schedule) * $ (Utility Rate))/Equivalent Catalog Efficiency. Expressed in dollars.

**Overall Pumping System Efficiency** : The Overall Pumping System Efficiency (%) is calculated by using the following formula: Overall Pumping System Efficiency (%) = Motor Efficiency (%) x Pump Hydraulic Efficiency (%) x "Piping" Efficiency (%).

**Peak Demand** : Peak demand typically measured as the maximum 15 or 30 minutes of kW consumption for a specific billing period. 

**Peak Rate** : Used by Utility to establish the peak rate basis for all consumption during a specified time period. Peak rates are intended to drive consumption modification by the Utility. 

**Phase** : The indication of the type of power supply for which the motor is designed. The two main
categories are single phase and three phase. Three-phase electric power systems have at least three conductors carrying voltage.

**"Piping" Efficiency** : The "Piping" Efficiency is the efficiency of the system pipework and is influenced by variables such as pipe internal roughness and leakages. "Piping" Efficiency is assumed to be equal to the efficiency of the discharge side piping and does not take into account the suction side pipework.  The "Piping" Efficiency is calculated using the following formula: "Piping" Efficiency (%) = (Pump Discharge Pressure - Static Discharge Head) / Pump Discharge Head).

**Portfolio Total HP** : Total motor portfolio HP (sum of all motor HP) both installed and spare
Power (W or watts): Power is an instantaneous reading. The power reading provided by a meter is the present flow of watts. Power is an instantaneous measurement. A Kilowatt (kW) – is a unit of electrical power equal to one thousand watts. 

**Power Factor** : Power Factor (PF) is the ratio of the real power to apparent power and represents how much real power electrical equipment utilizes. It is a measure of how effectively electrical power is being used. A measurement of the phase relationship between voltage and current in an electrical system. Induction loads, such as electric motors, tend to reduce power factors. Most three-phase motors have a power-factor rating to indicate how much impact they impose on the system. Significantly low power factors can reduce the efficiency of an entire electrical system, so many utilities charge extra to industrial facilities whose power factor is low. Capacitors can be used to correct this problem. 

**Power Quality** : The conditions of voltage level, phase balance, power factor, and harmonics in the power supply. Poor power quality reduces the efficiency and reliability of electrical equipment, including that of motors. Various strategies, such as transformer adjustments and modifications to circuit loads can be used to optimize voltage levels and phase balance, raise the power factor, and minimize harmonics in the electrical distribution system. 

**Pump Discharge Pressure** : The Pump Discharge Pressure is the pressure measured at the discharge flange of the pump using a Pressure Gauge.  The value can be entered in meters of head, bar or psi.

**Pump Discharge Flow Rate** : The Pump Discharge Flow Rate is the flow rate measured at the pump discharge flange using a Flow Meter.  It can be entered in meters cubed per hour or imperial gallons per hour (where 1 imperial gallon = 4.55 liters)

**Pump Hydraulic Power Output** : The Pump Hydraulic Power Output is the power imparted to the fluid by the pump in kW.  It is calculated using the following formula: Pump Hydraulic Power Output (kW) = (Fluid Density (kg/m3) x Acceleration due to Gravity, g (m/s2) x Total Head (m) x Flow Rate (m3/h)) / 367,000.

**Pump Hydraulic Efficiency** : This is the efficiency of the pump in turning input shaft power (from the motor) into useful power output to the fluid (Hydraulic Power), it is calculated using the following formula: Pump Hydraulic Efficiency (%) = Pump Hydraulic Power Output (kW) x 100 / Pump Input Shaft Power (kW). The Pump Input Shaft Power is the same as the Motor Shaft Power.

**Pump Inlet, Outlet Diameter and Velocity Head** : If the Pump Inlet Diameter is not equal to the Pump Outlet Diameter the difference in velocity head across the pump has to be accounted for (this figure will generally be very small).  If the Inlet and Outlet diameters are equal the Velocity Head difference will be zero.

**Pumping Loss** : Pumping Loss (%) = 1 - Pump Efficiency (%)

**Open Drip Proof (ODP)** : Allows air to blow directly through the motor, but has a cover that prevents drops of liquid from Entering. ODP motors are suitable for protected environments.

**Rate** : Electric utility rates for “real” power consumption by industrial and commercial facilities. Rates are usually comprised of at least two components. One is the “energy rate” or the kilowatt-hour charge. A second is the “demand rate”, the kilowatt, or kVA demand charge. Electricity Average Unit Price (AUP) are calculated from electricity bills - it is the total amount charged in a period (including fixed charges) divided by the total number of units used in that period. Time-Of-Use (TOU) pricing is a variable rate structure that charges for energy depending on the time of day and the season the energy is used. With TOU rates, the Electric Bill will be determined by both when electricity is consumed and how much is consumed.

**R.P.M.** : The speed at which full-load torque is delivered for the rated voltage and frequency. The difference of the full load speed and the synchronous speed is called “slip”. The motor’s “slip” is determined by it’s design. For most induction motors, full load speed can be between 96% and 99% of the no load speed.

**ROA** : Return on Assets

**ROI** : Return on Investment

**Safety and Standards designation** : Nameplate designation; NEMA Premium, Canadian Standards Association, and UL recognized.

**Service factor** : A multiplier that indicates a motor’s ability to produce more than its designated full load. A 10-horsepower motor with a 1.15 service factor could run continuously with an 11.5-horsepower load without overheating, although operating a motor above rated load reduces efficiency and service life. For example, a motor with a 1.0 service factor cannot be expected to handle more than its nameplate hp on a continuous basis. A motor with a 1.15 service factor can be expected to safely handle infrequent loads to 15% past it’s rated horsepower.

**SIC Efficiency** : SIC Efficiency =100 -((SIC Group Efficiency - Design Performance)/SIG Group Efficiency) where SIC Group Efficiency is Design performance of all Motors@Work Customers within the same SIC Code excluding the Customer.

**SIC Rank** :  SIC Rank =100 -((SIC Group Efficiency - Design Performance)/SIG Group Efficiency) where SIC Group Efficiency is Design Performance Efficiency of all Motors@Work Customers within the same SIC Code excluding the Customer. Rank is determined by quartile range of SIC Group efficiency. Range expressed in quartiles.  

**Simple payback** : The time required for the energy savings from investment to repay its initial costs with no interest or cost of capital considered. 

**SPEC** : Nameplate number. Provides bill of material to locate parts

**Speed** : Electric motors have two speed ratings Synchronous Speed and Full-load RPM.

**Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)** : SIC is a system for classifying industries by a four-digit code. It is used by government agencies to classify industry areas. The SIC system is also used by agencies in other countries. In the United States the SIC code is being supplanted by the six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS code), which was released in 1997; however certain government departments and agencies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), still use the SIC codes. The SIC codes can be grouped into progressively broader industry classifications: industry group, major group, and division. The first 3 digits of the SIC code indicate the industry group, and the first two digits indicate the major group. Each division encompasses a range of SIC codes

- SIC Industry Group: The Standard Industrial Classification SIC is a system for classifying industries by a four-digit code. it is used by government agencies to classify industry areas. The SIC codes can be grouped into progressively broader industry classifications: industry group, major group, and division.

- SIC Industry: Select the SIC Industry within the SIC Industry Group. Within each SIC Industry Group you can select the SIC Industry you are in. Every company will have a primary SIC code. This number indicates a company’s primary line of business. What determines a company’s primary SIC code is the code definition that generates the highest revenue for that company at a specific location in the past year. 

**Starting or Locked-Rotor Torque** : is the maximum torque that the motor can produce from a complete stop or “locked rotor”. 

**Static Suction Head** : The Static Suction Head is the vertical distance between the centerline of the pump inlet and the waterline of the source.  It can either be positive or negative depending on the location of the source.  If the source is above the pump the Static Suction Head is negative, if the source is below the pump the value is positive.

**Static Discharge Head** : The Static Discharge Head is the vertical distance between the centerline of the pump discharge outlet and the waterline of the reservoir or final destination that the system is pumping to.  If the reservoir is above the pump the value is positive; in the unlikely event that the reservoir is below the pump, the value is negative.

**Synchronous Speed** : The speed at which the motor’s magnetic field rotates. The database includes motors with synchronous speeds of 900, 1,200, 1,800, and 3,600 rpm. 

**System Friction Losses (Discharge Side)** : These are the due to internal friction in the system piping on the Discharge Side of the pump.  They are calculated using the following formula: System Friction Losses = Pump Discharge Pressure - Static Discharge Head.

**Thrust** : This is a measure of the downward force on the bearings of a vertical shaft motor. 

**Time Zone** :  A time zone refers to any of the 24 regions loosely divided by longitude, where the same standard time is kept. A list of time zones is provided in Appendix – A.

**Torque** : A measure of torsional or twisting force measured in foot-pounds (pounds of weight on a 1-foot lever arm). Three torque ratings are included in the Motors@Work database.

**Torque Speed Curve Design (DES)** : The nameplate design letter indicates the shape of the torque curve.

**Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)** : Power system harmonics distort the shape of the perfect voltage and current sinusoidal waveforms ideal to the power grid, and are multiples of the fundamental grid frequencies of 50 or 60 hertz found throughout the world. Problems caused by harmonics include overloaded circuits and higher system losses that can lead to premature equipment failure in utility and customer systems. Low utility power factor is generally associated with harmonics in electric metering.

**Total Head** : The Total Head is the overall head supplied by the pump (both Suction Side and Discharge Side).  It is calculated using the following equation: Total Head = Static Suction Head + Pump Discharge Head + Change in Velocity Head) where the Change in Velocity Head is: Change in Velocity Head = (Inlet Velocity - Outlet Velocity)2 (m/s)2 / 2 x g (m/s2).  The Velocity is calculated using the equation: Velocity (m/s) = Flowrate (m3/h) / (Area (m2) x 3,600).

**Total Installed HP** :  Total motor portfolio HP (sum of all motor HP) installed 

**Total Losses** :  Total Losses (%) = Motor Loss (%) + Pumping Loss (%)  + Friction Loss (%)

**Totally Enclosed Air Over (TEAO)**: Dust-tight fan and blower duty motors designed for shaft mounted fans or belt driven fans. The motor must be mounted within the airflow of the fan.

**Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled (TEFC)** : motors are designed to prevent outside air from flowing into the frame. Fins and a fan provide cooling. TEFC motors can function outdoors and in dusty or contaminated environments. 

**Totally Enclosed Non-ventilated (TENV)** : motors are not equipped for cooling by means external to the enclosing parts. 

**Totally Enclosed Washed Down (TEWD)** : Designed to withstand high pressure wash-downs or other high humidity or wet environments. Available on TEAO, TEFC and ENV enclosures totally enclosed, hostile and severe environment motors.

**Utility Budget (Base Year)** : Basis to monitor energy consumption and cost against base yea. Can be used to inform users of budget performance issues on a month-to-date and year-to-date basis. Helps identify where to focus energy management efforts, and enables setting realistic energy management goals. 

**Utility Bill Audits** : Based on Monthly Utility Bill Identify billing problems warranting immediate attention prior to payments.  Audits can also identify potential energy efficiency and conservation opportunities.

**Volume of Fluid Displaced** : Volume of Fluid Displaced (m3) = Pump Discharge Flowrate (m3/h) x Operating Hours (hrs.)

**Voltage (V or Volts)** : Voltage rating at which the motor is designed to operate most efficiently. Motors are designed to operate at plus or minus a 10% tolerance of this value.  A motor with a 460V rating could operate effectively at around 414V to 506V. Note: Motors run in this 10% range will not perform optimally, but will perform effectively.
