## **Glossary**

**Ambient and Time (RATING)** : The rating of the motor is the ambient (room) temperature vs. the time it can operate at that temperature. Most motors are rated for continuous duty. The most common rating is 400C AMB-CONT.

**Amps (Amperes)** : The measure of electrical current. Amp ratings indicate the average motor input current the motor can be expected to draw under full load conditions. There are three common motor amp ratings: 
- No-load amps is the current draw when the motor is unloaded. 
- Full-load amps is the current required during full-rated load operation. 
- Locked-rotor or start-up amps is the current when the motor rotor is stopped or locked and indicates the maximum amount of current that could be expected during the first few seconds of startup. 

**Annual Motor Expense (Change)** : (Annual Motor Expense (Last Year) - Annual Motor Expense (YTD))/Annual Motor Expense (Last Year) * 100; expressed as %. Indicator indicates % trend.

**Annual Motor Expense (Last Year)** : Comparable (to Year to Date time period) year-to-date summary of Motor Portfolio Expense from previous year.

**Annual Motor Expense (YTD)** : Year-to-date summary of Motor Portfolio Expense.

**Apparent Power (kVA)** : The apparent power (measured in kVA) is calculated using the following formula: Apparent Power (kVA) = âˆš3 x Voltage (V) x Current (A)

**Base Load** : Base load in the non-weather related load. 

**Base Year** : Established base to assess on-going energy performance.

**Bearings DE** : Drive End (output shaft end) bearing number.

**Bearings ODE** : Opposite Drive End (fan end or rear of motor) bearing number.

**Breakdown torque** : Maximum torque that the operating motor can produce before stalling. 

**Best Practice; Motor Efficiency: This value is equivalent to the highest efficiency motor available on the market, equal in size to the motor in use in the system being analyzed.  Motors@Work performs analysis of equivalent size and specifications to the one in use in the pumping system being analyzed, and use its motor efficiency value as the Best Practice Value.

Best Practice: Pump Hydraulic Efficiency: This value is equivalent to the highest value currently attainable in industry. Values are available from the MyPumps measurements. The MyPumps measurements will provide an "Optimal Efficiency" value for the Pump Efficiency, input this value as Best Practice.

Best Practice: Design Friction Losses: The Friction Losses that the system was designed for (in meters of head per kilometer of pipeline), if known.  If unknown, Motors@Work provides some typical values to calculate the system pressure drop.

Catalog Motor Efficiency: Catalog Motor Efficiency =100 - ((Equivalent Catalog Motor Efficiency - Motor Actual Efficiency)/Equivalent Catalog Motor Efficiency 

Catalog number: Manufacturer motor model type identifier. If nameplate is blank the motor is custom. Number may also a unique OEM part or modification.

CC: Nameplate Certified Compliant number. This number appears on all motors that require compliance with U.S. energy law.

CO2e Emission Factor (Electricity): Different electricity suppliers have different Emission Factors, which reflect the different generation mixes from which the suppliers source their electricity. 
Current (I or amps): Current is the rate at which electric charge flows past a point in a circuit. Current is normally based on a second as the unit of measure. 
Demand (kWh or kilo-watt hrs.): Demand is also a time-based value. The demand is the average rate of energy use over time. The actual label for demand is kilowatt-hours/hour but this is normally reduced to kilowatts. To calculate demand it is necessary to accumulate the energy readings and adjust the energy reading to an hourly value that constitutes the demand.
