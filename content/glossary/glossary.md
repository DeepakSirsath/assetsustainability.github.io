## **Glossary**

**Ambient and Time (RATING)** : The rating of the motor is the ambient (room) temperature vs. the time it can operate at that temperature. Most motors are rated for continuous duty. The most common rating is 400C AMB-CONT.

**Amps (Amperes)** : The measure of electrical current. Amp ratings indicate the average motor input current the motor can be expected to draw under full load conditions. There are three common motor amp ratings: 
	No-load amps is the current draw when the motor is unloaded. 
	Full-load amps is the current required during full-rated load operation. 
	Locked-rotor or start-up amps is the current when the motor rotor is stopped or locked and indicates the maximum amount of current that could be expected during the first few seconds of startup.
