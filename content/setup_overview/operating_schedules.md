## **Operating Schedules**

On the Operating Schedules you can enter operating schedules for a company. These schedules can then be associated to the company, facility, department and process entities in the tree of facilities, departments and processes. Ultimately the operating schedule is assigned to a motor and will form the basis for energy consumption calculations. 

**Description** : Enter a unique identifier description for the operating schedule attached to your company, facility or motor. You should identify if it’s a weekly or monthly schedule.

**Out of service** : You can select or unselect checkbox depending on if the operating schedule is currently being used.  When this field is checked then this particular Operating Schedule will not show on any other screen.

**Operating Schedule (detail)** : Enter the daily (day of the week) start and end times of operation in hours and minutes. User should also add how many months in the year are following this schedule. There is an option to copy each day’s schedule for user convenience. Note: Detail tab is accessed by hi-liting specific Operating Schedule in grid.
