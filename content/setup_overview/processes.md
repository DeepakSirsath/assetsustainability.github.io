## **Processes**

On the Processes screen you can enter the processes for a department. The process is directly under the department in the tree of company, facilities, departments and processes.

**Name** : Enter name of the process.

**Facility** : Selects the facility (that the process belongs to). By doing this, the process gets linked to the chosen/selected facility. 

**Department** : Select the department that the process belongs to. This links the department to the process.

**Operating schedule** : Enter an operating schedule for each process. The operating schedule will form the basis for energy consumption calculations.

**Out of Service** :  You can select or unselect checkbox depending on if the process is currently operational. When this field is checked this particular process will not show up on any other screens.
