## **Regions**

On the Regions you can enter regions. Regions are used to define a group of countries where the currency is similar and where the OEM can maintain prices for catalogue items per region, rather than per individual country.

**Name of Region** : Enter the name of the region. For example, North America, South-Eastern Asia, Western Europe, Southern Africa.

**Out of service** : You can select or unselect checkbox depending on if the Region are currently being used.  When this field is checked then this particular Region will not show on any other screen.



## **Countries for Regions (Tab)**

On the Countries tab of the Regions screen the OEM user can enter and maintain countries that belong to a Region. Countries can be added or deleted.

**Country** : User selects a country that belongs to the region previously entered by the user. The dropdown will only show countries from the selected region.
