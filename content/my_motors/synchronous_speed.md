## Synchronous Speed (R.P.M.)

Synchronous Speed is the theoretical speed of the motor when no load is placed
on it (no friction).  The synchronous speed of a motor can often be found on
its nameplate.

Motors@Work uses the synchronous speed of the motor when calculating motor
load using the Voltage Compensated Slip methodology.
