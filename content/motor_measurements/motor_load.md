## Calculating Motor Load

Motors@Work has four methods of calculating motor load.  The system will use the best
formula for the data entered in the measurement.  If data used in the calculation is
missing, the system will attempt to use the next strategy in the list.

- [kW Ratio – Power Based](/kw-ratio-power-based)
- [kW Ratio – Voltage based](/kw-ratio-voltage-based)
- [Voltage Compensated Amps Ratio](/voltage-compensated-amps-ratio)
- [Voltage Compensated Slip](/voltage-compensated-slip)
