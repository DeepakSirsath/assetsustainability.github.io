## **Fault Detection & Diagnosis** 


**Motor failure classification** : Motor typically fail for the following reasons:
- Bearings (51%); Potential Causes; Lubrication, mechanical, shaft currents, heat, and contamination (e.g. incompatible greases, overload, misalignment, belt tension & pulley issues, condensation and misapplication)
- Windings (16%); Potential Causes; Over voltage, water, overload, under voltage, and environment
- External Factors (16%); Potential Causes; Environmental or load related
- Rotor Bars (5%); Potential Causes; Overload, locked rotor, or vibration
- Shaft/Coupling (2%); Potential Causes; Mechanical or overload
- Unknown (10%); No Causes determined

**Current Unbalance** : Current Unbalance > 10%

**Motor Efficiency Below Design** :  Measured Motor Efficiency < Full Load Efficiency by more than 5%

**Motor Load approaching Service Factor** : Motor Load >= 100% and < Service Factor * 100

**Motor Load exceeds Service Factor** : Motor Load >= Service Factor * 100

**Motor Operating at Sub-optimal Load** : Motor Load < 50%

**Power Factor** :

**Total Harmonic Distortion** : 

**Vibration** :

**Insulation Resistance** : 

**Surge/Motor Circuit** :

**Circuit Analysis** : 

**Voltage Unbalance** : Indicator of power quality resulting in of energy quality, efficiency, and motor performance degradation due to unequal (phase) incoming line voltage or current. Voltage unbalance degrades the performance and shortens the life of a three-phase motor. Voltage unbalance at the motor terminals can cause current unbalance that is far out of proportion to the voltage unbalance. Unbalanced currents lead to torque pulsations, increased vibrations and mechanical stresses, increased losses resulting in lower efficiency, and motor overheating, which reduces winding insulation life.
It is recommended that voltage unbalances at the motor terminals do not exceed 1%. Unbalances that exceed 1% require derating of the motor, per NEMA MG-1-2011, and will void most manufacturers’ warranties. Motors@Work calculates your motor’s voltage unbalance when you enter measurements for the three different voltages between the terminals of the three-phase motor.
